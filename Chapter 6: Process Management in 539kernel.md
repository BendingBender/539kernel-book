# Chapter 6: Process Management in 539kernel

## Introduction
The final result of this chapter is what I call version `T` of 539kernel which has a basic multitasking capability. The multitasking style that we are going to implement is time-sharing multitasking. Also, instead of depending on x86 features to implement multitasking in 539kernel, a software multitasking will be implemented. Our first step of this implementation is to setup a valid task-state segment, while 539kernel implements a software multitasking, a valid TSS is needed. As we have said earlier, it will not be needed in our current stage, but we will set it up anyway. Its need will show up when the kernel lets user-space software to run. After that, basic data structures for process table and process control block are implemented. These data structures and their usage will be as simple as possible since we don't have any mean for dynamic memory allocation, yet! After that, the scheduler can be implemented and system timer's interrupt can be used to enforce preemptive multitasking by calling the scheduler every period of time. The scheduler uses round-robin algorithm to choose the next process that will use the CPU time, and the context switch is performed after that. Finally, we are going to create a number of processes to make sure that everything works fine. But before that, we need to organize our code a little bit since it's going to be larger starting from this point.
