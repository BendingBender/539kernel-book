# Chapter 7: What's Next?
## Introduction
And now, after writing a simple operating system kernel and learning the basics of creating kernels, the question is "What's Next?". Obviously, there is a lot to do after creating 539kernel and the most straightforward answers for our question are the basic well-known answers, such as: enabling user-space environment in your kernel, implementing virtual memory, providing graphical user interface or porting the kernel to another architecture. This list is a short list of what you can do next with your kernel.

Previously, I've introduced the term *kernelist* ^[In chapter <!-- [REF] --> where the distinction between a kernelist and implementer has been established.] in which I mean the person who works on designing an operating system kernels with modern innovative solutions to solve real-world problem. You can continue with your hobby kernel and implementing the well-known concepts of traditional operating systems that we have just mentioned a little of them, but if you want to create something that can be more useful and special than a traditional kernel, then I think you should consider playing the role of a kernelist.

I've already said that the kernelist doesn't need to propose her own solutions for the problems that she would like to solve. Instead of using the old well-known solutions, a kernelist searches for other better solutions for the given problem and designs an operating system kernel that uses these solutions. Scientific papers (papers for short) are the best place to find novel and innovative ideas that solve real-world problem, most probably, these ideas haven't been implemented or adopted by others yet^[Scientific papers can be searched for through a dedicated search engine, for example, Google Scholar.].

In this chapter, I've chosen a bunch of scientific papers that propose new solutions for real-world problem and I'll show you a high-level overview of these solutions and my goal is to encourage the interested people to start looking to the scientific papers and use their solutions. Also, I would like to show how the researches on operating systems field^[Or simply the kernelists!] innovate clever solutions and get over the challenges. However, before starting with the chosen papers, the first section of this chapter discusses general concepts that are related to operating systems, we haven't discussed these concepts previously and they will be needed to make the papers that we are going to present easier to grasp. A small note should be mentioned, this chapter only shows an overview of each paper which means if you are really interesting on the problem and the solution the a given paper represents, then it's better to read it^[It is easy to get a copy of any mentioned paper in this chapter, you just need to search for its title in Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and a link to a PDF will show for you.].
