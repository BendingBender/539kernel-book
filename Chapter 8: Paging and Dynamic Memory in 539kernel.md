# Chapter 8: Paging and Dynamic Memory in 539kernel

## Introduction
The last result of this chapter is version `G` of 539kernel which contains the basic stuff that are related to the memory. Previously, we have seen that we have no way in 539kernel to allocate memory dynamically, due to that, the allocation of entries of processes table and the process control block was a static allocation. Making dynamic allocation possible is an important thing since a lot of kernel's objects need to be allocated dynamically. Therefore, the first memory-related thing to implement is a way to allocate memory dynamically. The other major part of version `G` is implementing paging by using x86 architecture's support. Since there is no way yet in 539kernel to access the hard disk, virtual memory cannot be implemented yet. However, basic paging can be implemented and this can be used as basis for further development.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
<!-- TODO: This part is largely duplicated with CH6. "The Data Structures of Processes". Merge them -->
In our normal process of developing applications by using programming languages that don't employ garbage collection, we are responsible for allocating spaces from memory. When we need to store data in memory, a free space should be there for this data so we can put it in this specific free space. The process of telling that we need `n` bytes and we are going to get these bytes from a specific free memory region, this process is known as memory allocation. There are two possible ways to allocate memory, statically or dynamically. Usually, a static memory allocation is used when we know the size of data at compile time, that is, before running the application that we are developing. Dynamic memory allocation is used when the size of data will be known at run time. Static memory allocation is the responsibility of the compiler of the language that we are using, while the dynamic memory allocation is the responsibility of the programmer ^[Not in all cases though.], also, the regions that we have allocated dynamically should be freed manually ^[This holds true in the case of programming languages like C. New system programming languages such as Rust for example may have different ways to deal with the matter. However, what we are discussing here is the basis and based on it more sophisticated concepts (e.g. Rust) can be built.]. As we have seen, there are multiple region of a running process's memory and each region has a different purpose, we already discussed run-time stack which is one of those region. The other data region of a process is known as *run-time heap*, or *heap* for short, but I prefer to use the long term to distinct the concept that we are discussing from a data structure also known as heap. When we allocate memory dynamically, the memory region that we have allocated is a part of the run-time heap, which is a large region of process memory that is used for dynamic allocation, in C, for example, the most well-known way to allocate bytes dynamically, that is, from the run-time heap is to use the function `malloc` which implements an algorithm known as *memory allocator*. The run-time heap need to be managed, due to that, this kind of algorithms are used with data structures that maintain information about the allocated space and free space.

A need of dynamic memory allocation have shown up previously in 539kernel. Therefore, in the current version 539kernel we are going to implement the most basic memory allocator possible.
